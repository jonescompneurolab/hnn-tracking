The algorithm proceeds by proposing new parameter sets to simulate at every iteration, and eventually converges when it is unable to identify new regions of parameter space that lower the loss.  Ideally you always want the algorithm to converge, so the  max_iter could be set to a ludicrously large number if you wanted. But in reality if there is something about that problem that keeps the optimizer running too many iterations, it may be good to precisely define what is ""too much"" by fixing the max_iter.  FYI it was surprisingly hard to dig up where COBYLA was first published with its formal mathematical definition. The analogy in the introduction is quite good at describing the problem: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-94-015-8330-5.pdf#page=57"

I will try to make a PR that adds this installation path to the Install page next week. It is several more steps than installing the non-MPI version in native Windows, *but* is arguably easier for the user since they can just copy and paste several commands in 2 windows (removing the requirement of installing the NEURON binary before the HNN-Core pip install, etc.). Also, once we start delivering a Conda package with HNN and MPI included for Linux, we will be able to use that same Linux-Conda-package as an installer on Windows (through WSL), and Windows users will *also* benefit from having to run many fewer commands."

I went through the code base and plotted to figure out that these changes have to be made in the `hnn_core/gui/_viz_manager.py` file. Function to change would be `_postprocess_template`.  I was thinking to create a list of templates that need the standardized y-axes Apply the same standardization logic to all templates in this list  like this: ``` dipole_layer_templates = ['Dipole Layers (3x1)', 'PSD Layers (3x1)'] ```  then take min of lower limits, max of upper limits and then apply them to fig.axes"

This was particularly true 10 years ago when the python ecosystem was still stabilizing. With time, folks have become more liberal adding dependencies but I still think the core package should be so easy to install that you can give someone a demo on any computer (Mac/Windows/Linux) in a matter of minutes. That's one of the reasons that MPI and nlopt were removed as core dependencies when I started developing hnn-core.   When adding a new core dependency, you should consider:  - is the package well-maintained and likely to continue be maintained in the future? - does the dependency itself have installation issues? e.g., too many dependencies? - is the package critical to the core functionality of the package? An optional dependency would be more appropriate if it's needed for only a couple of functions  Now, in the case of hnn-gui specifically I would say that `ipywidgets` underwent a huge overhaul recently which broke the `voila` and `ipywidgets` combo ... it's supported by the Jupyter team, so I do think it will continue to be maintained. But we should perhaps wait and watch for a bit."

Here is some example code that illustrates this:  ```{python} #!/usr/bin/env python  from hnn_core import jones_2009_model, MPIBackend, simulate_dipole net = jones_2009_model() location = 'proximal' burst_std = 20 weights_ampa_p = {'L2_pyramidal': 1.0, 'L5_pyramidal': 1.0} syn_delays_p = {'L2_pyramidal': 0.1, 'L5_pyramidal': 1.}  net.add_bursty_drive(     'alpha_prox', tstart=50., burst_rate=10, burst_std=burst_std, numspikes=2,     spike_isi=10, n_drive_cells=10, location=location,     weights_ampa=weights_ampa_p, synaptic_delays=syn_delays_p, event_seed=284)  # When I run this longer simulation, I get the following, which includes the drive: # net.cell_response.cell_types are ['L2_basket', 'L2_pyramidal', 'L5_basket', 'L5_pyramidal', 'alpha_prox']  with MPIBackend(n_procs=8):     dpl = simulate_dipole(net, tstop=310., n_trials=1)  print(f'net.cell_response.cell_types are {net.cell_response.cell_types}')  # When I run this shorter simulation, I get the following, which is missing 'L5_basket': # net.cell_response.cell_types are ['L2_basket', 'L2_pyramidal', 'L5_pyramidal', 'alpha_prox']  with MPIBackend(n_procs=8):     dpl = simulate_dipole(net, tstop=30., n_trials=1)  print(f'net.cell_response.cell_types are {net.cell_response.cell_types}') ```  This means that `CellResponse.cell_types` cannot be relied on for ""cell type"" information, as opposed to ""unique spike types"" which is a better name for it (similar to how it's used here https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core/blob/master/hnn_core/viz.py#L608 ).  I see two ways to approach this:  1. I think is the best way: We remove all ""cell type"" language from `CellResponse`'s use, and instead treat all ""unique spike types that have spiked during the trial"" the same. 2. We split the spike data into two parts, one for spikes of true ""cell types"" and one for spikes of drives. This is very clunky and bad design, including that eventually, we may want to add other things besides celltypes and drives.  Regardless, we should make discriminating between ""cell type"" spikes and ""drive"" spikes very clear and easy, including in plotting. Just like with wagdy88's changes, we could force the `CellResponse` user to supply true cell type names, and then we would always know if a spike type is a celltype or a drive. We could then (optionally) have a default true flag for plotting functions that only plots true celltypes by default (as opposed to drives). This would also make other things easier, like informing the user who is plotting a celltype that, if it is not found but in `_cell_type_names`, then that celltype can't be plotted because it produced no spikes, not that it's an incorrect name, etc. We could also remove all the celltype defaults from the plotting code that `CellResponse` uses, and also have a mapping at initialization time between all unique spike types and colors, so the colors are consistent. Alternatively, we could move all celltype info to `Network`, and have any `CellResponse` usage consume the info from `Network`."

CSD/LFP for basket cells look the same as if the network isn't driven.  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1060f5bc-a0ac-48d3-beb7-b746a6eb7f65)  Whenever I look at stained laminar layers or visualizations in textbooks, I always see some kind of offset between cell bodies.  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecec7861-6743-4bd7-8434-2732f07a32e0)  this one was taken from https://neupsykey.com/the-cerebral-cortex-2/  My impression is that it's not super biologically plausible that we have absolutely no jitter between somas, even of the same type.  A downside of doing this could be that in the context of the GSoC project, we are working on placing different extracellular cells on the same plane, and keeping track of cell types on planes might make the job a bit easier, and avoid cell bodies ending up on top of each other.  Curious to hear your thoughts! :)"

The issue came about while comparing HNN’s LFP/CSD simulations to animal data for my MMN paper which I was struggling to do. When I plotted the cell boundaries, Steph noticed an offset between basket cells and pyramidal neurons which we thought might not be biologically realistic. But thanks to @katduecker identifying the hnn_core issue where cell spatial information wasn't being transferred to NEURON (#1062), we suspect this bug was the reason our model's LFP/CSD couldn't be accurately compared to the animal data.  I agree that the soma position of basket cells only matters if the point neurons contribute to the dipole/LFP/CSD. If they don't, then it shouldn't make a difference. I do see a **very** weak source-sink-source pattern in the L2_basket and L5_basket CSD simulations @katduecker provided, but it is likely negligible (in both cases, the pattern appears in the supra-granular layers so I'm not even sure wether the basket cells are responsible). I also haven't found any evidence suggesting basket cells and pyramidal neurons should be on the exact same plane. The figures below are from rat motor cortex: pyramidal neuron somas (blue in Fig 1, dark in Fig 2) and parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneuron somas (green in Fig 1, pink in Fig 2) show distinct positions (https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0567-20.2021).  <img src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ed1f761-c820-4a0f-91f2-2bb9c4ee1472"" width=""400""> <img src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f6d9f7a-1dda-48ab-9df3-dfad89c271b7"" width=""400"">"

Our developers have finite time and there is a lot of work to do on HNN with different priority levels, but we are working hard to assist everyone.  Regarding the plot, it looks good! I would make some small suggestions:  1. Instead of using the summed weight values, I would suggest that you ""normalize"" the data to be between 0 and 1 (one way to do this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling#Rescaling_(min-max_normalization) ). This is useful when we're more interested in the *relative* difference between two values than in the *absolute* difference between two values(e.g. relative: ""`poisson->L5_pyramidal` is about 67% the strength of `evoked_drive->L5_pyramidal`""). In this case, we're more interested in relative differences. This would change the plot to show only values between 0 and 1, which instantly lets us see how strong a certain connection is versus the maximum strength in the network. Better yet, add this as an optional argument to the plotting function, so that a user can still get the ""absolute"" version if they want. 2. Test case: plot a version that has an ""empty"" drive where all the drive weights are 0 by default, then make sure it's still plotted. This could be a test that you add in `test_viz.py` for this new plot type. 3. In the ""absolute"" case, it would be helpful to indicate the units on the plot itself.  Also, if you feel you have developed the code to a ""good working state"" that you're satisfied with, or simply in a state where you want feedback on it, please push it to your branch so that I can see it here in this PR. This includes **even if it is not the final version that will be merged**. Until the PR is accepted and rebased onto our `master` branch, you have the full freedom to make any code changes to your local branch, including additional commits, or even ""rewriting history"" if you make mistakes (see here for a guide https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History ). In other words, at least for HNN, don't feel that you only need to push your commits when the code is absolutely complete and finished -- feel free to push your commits as soon as you want! We prefer the latter, actually, since it helps us understand how the code is being developed."

If we don't currently support this fine of a degree of recording, then this current issue will have to be put on hold.

Eventually, completely deprecate use of the ""flat JSON"" filetype (e.g. https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core/blob/master/hnn_core/param/default.json ) and the use of the `params.py` module in favor of the GUI-compatible, larger ""hierarchical JSON"" (e.g. https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core/blob/master/hnn_core/param/jones2009_base.json ) and the `hnn_io.py` module?      - This would allow us to keep `params.py`'s behavior as-is (bugs/etc. included).      - We would need to guide lab members and HNN users on converting ""old workflows"" that use any ""flat JSON"" files over to using the API to set parameters, etc. We should be doing this anyways, and still need to update and add tutorials that use `read_network_configuration` and `write...` and that document the OVERALL workflow on a file-level basis.      - All API code that uses the `params.py` module (especially `network_models.py`, such as `jones_model_2009()`'s `add_drives_from_params` option) should be modified or replaced as-needed (for example, drive creation in `jones_model_2009(add_drives_from_params=True)` using a new subfunction in `network_models.py` directly.      - Perhaps the current `legacy_mode` could be renamed to `legacy_mode_v1` and code using the the ""flat JSON"" files separated into behavior called by a new `legacy_mode_v2` flag. Again, to be clear, I'm not talking about *deleting* the `params.py` module, but simply deprecating it while keeping it around.      - This would take some work, BUT this could surface any existing bugs or surprising-behavior (such as found in #1180).      - This is what I prefer.  2. Alternatively, keep maintaining (as in keep-updating) both the older `params.py` style and newer `hnn_io.py` style?      - This is more maintenance burden in the long-term, since we would have to actively support both.      - We would still need to make a decision about which to include in tutorial content.      - This would involve making CHANGES to `params.py` that would probably NOT be backwards compatible with every use of the ""flat JSON"" approach, such as in #1180. It would be a bad and messy idea, but would introduce multiple ""legacy_modes"" to `params.py` alone.  3. Something else? For example, we could update `params.py` for the not-backwards-compatible changes in #1180, but also communicate that we will be officially deprecating it at a certain time in the future (a year? two?). We could then say we will help anyone currently using HNN to port their workflow over (which we should do in the case of Option 1 anyways).  This decision impacts #1180 and #1140 as well."

The first step is to design what we want future Network handling to look like, from the user's perspective. This is, arguably, almost complete:  - Network Creation options:     - Default network, empty drives: `net = jones_2009_model()`. Same as before.     - Default network, standard drives: `net = jones_2009_model(add_canonical_drives=True)`, or something like it. The new `add_canonical_drives` argument would be a replacement for `add_drives_from_params`, which would be deprecated. This new argument would add the drives using a function, and be independent of both `params.py` and any ""flat JSON"" files such as `param/default.json`.     - Custom network (advanced users only): `net = Network()`. Same as before.     - Katharina's network: fully analogous to `jones_2009_model()`, but called via a different function, such as `duecker_2025_model()`.     - **Discussion Point**: Should we re-build the network from scratch by default, or load a hierarchical-JSON version such as from `param/jones2009_base.json` every time?  - Network Loading options:     - One and only one way: `hnn_io.read_network_configuration`. **We should probably do #926 before all of this work.** Also, this function needs to be expanded to include logic that detects and accomodates backwards-compatibility, possibly including flat-JSON files.     - Saving and loading networks should be encouraged to users in the tutorials.  - Network Saving options:     - One and only one way: `hnn_io.write_network_configuration`. **We should probably do #926 before all of this work.**     - **Discussion Point**: **Whatever is the current way to save a Network's simulated dipoles, and any other output data, should be mentioned frequently in our Tutorials.** A full discussion of saving and organizing our output data is outside the scope of this issue, but we also need to make it clear to users that **saving the Network is not the same thing as saving simulation output**.  2. Then, we implement the new approach and update all our Tutorials to use the above design. **We then push a new Release, so that the new approach is available.**  3. Then, we announce to users that they should begin transitioning away from BOTH `jones_2009_model(add_drives_from_params=True)` AND any `params` or ""flat JSON"" usage, since it is being deprecated. Any existing use of `add_drives_from_params` should be replaced by `add_canonical_drives` argument (or whatever we choose), and any use of ""flat JSON"" ""param-style"" file parameters (including use of `read_params`) should be replaced with explicit setting of equivalent variables at the `Network` API level. **This means that for every variable in the ""flat JSON"" files, we need to document how to set that variable at the API level**.  4. At this point, the default ""stack"" should now not use any code from `params.py`, `params_default.py`, or `param/default.json`. Perhaps we leave them where they are, or move them into a `backwards_compat` module."

See documentation on how to build our current releases here https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/dev/how_to_create_releases.html .   Additionally, we have updated and activated our Github Actions so that they can build our PyPI packages *inside the Actions themselves*, followed by automatic uploading to the PyPI index using Trusted Publishing. See #1073, #1077, #1081, and #1090.

This changes everything!!!  It appears that the developers of `mpi4py` have begun maintaining a *`pip`-installable version of OpenMPI*, starting 3 months ago https://pypi.org/project/openmpi/#files . I didn't catch this because it is relatively recent - I definitely have poured over the `mpi4py` Installation page you linked frequently and in detail over the last year, but not since I built our `conda` packages in May (see #950).  This is fantastic, because it means that if their `pip openmpi` package works, **we can drop our `conda` packaging entirely**, and forget about needing `conda` for our OpenMPI installation! We could exclusively use `pip` and `uv` for developer and user installation.  Even *more* exciting is that if we don't need `conda` anymore for either OpenMPI installation or packaging, *then we can start shipping binary wheels*! We can pre-compile the MOD files that users need across platforms (using local or Github Actions), then ship a PyPI wheel that works with the `pip openmpi` package. (We could probably do this already, but previously it wasn't worth the time: we were already pre-compiling platform-specific `conda` packages for the same purpose.) This is especially nice since it means users probably (?) won't need to download compilers like GCC (Linux) or Xcode Command-Line Tools (Mac) just to run a simulation.  Thanks for bringing my attention to this Mainak! If the `pip openmpi` package works on all our platforms (which it almost certainly does), then both myself and new users installing HNN will be much happier :)"

Firstly, unfortunately conda currently has no equivalent to `pip`'s ""`extras`"" https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core/blob/master/setup.py#L78-L86 which we strongly rely on for providing variant installers. It has been requested for many years by many people, and while there is activity towards it right now, I have no idea how long it will take (months? years?). If you are interested, here are some links (putting then in a code block in order to not ""mention"" them):  ``` main spec work, active https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/111 https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/7502 https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/11053 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42587385/install-extras-with-conda ```  In the meantime, as some of the discussions like in 7502 above have pointed out, a common workaround is to simply publish multiple packages in conda, where there's a separate package for each variant. This would imply that the equivalent of, for example, `pip install ""hnn_core[gui,parallel]""` would be something like `conda install hnn-core-gui hnn-core-parallel` etc., which I think is reasonable. This is obviously a bigger maintenance burden than trying to provide a single conda package, but it follows the same philosophy as our current install landscape.  Here's a proposal for the list of separate `conda` packages to create:  - `hnn-core`: the minimal core, just like installing `pip install hnn-core`. - `hnn-core-gui`: identical to `pip install ""hnn-core[gui]""`, installs minimal `hnn-core` along with the `gui` dependencies. - `hnn-core-opt`: identical to `pip install ""hnn-core[opt]""`, installs minimal `hnn-core` along with `scikit-learn`. - `hnn-core-parallel`: This is the entire reason for using conda in the first place. This will install the dependencies inherent to `pip install ""hnn-core[parallel]""` in addition to the `conda-forge` versions of `mpi4py` and `openmpi>5` for MacOS and Linux. As usual, Windows support will be left for future work, if ever. - `hnn-core-all`: (Optional) We could also provide a ""meta-package"" that simply installs all of the above. I'm 50/50 on this, but it is a common pattern used in package managers. - Note: I don't see any reason for making an `hnn-core-docs` equivalent of `pip install ""hnn-core[docs]""`. - Note: There is no need for an `hnn-core-test` equivalent of  `pip install ""hnn-core[test]""` for two reasons:     1. There is already a way for advanced users to install the testable dependencies.     2. All of the above conda packages will already be testable in-place, due to conda packages' support for testing ( https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#test-requirements ).  That covers all of the current install variants.   All of the above is entirely up for discussion, of course."

Currently, I'm doing testing using the scripts + recipe files located at https://github.com/asoplata/gh-testbench/tree/main/conda-packaging though note that that repo is known to change rapidly (it's only for random testing) and break its directory structure. There's still polishing left to do for the build-recipes (removing unnecessary dependencies, preparing them for importation to the conda-forge ecosystem, etc.).  I mention the above platforms specifically since: 1. Linux on arm64, more commonly known as `aarch64`: I don't think we should support explicit `conda` builds for this at this time, because:      1. AFAIK, no HNN developers have access to any computers with that hardware, for testing     2. As far as I can tell, Linux on Arm is only common for server usage, and very rare for personal computers. On top of that, any servers/HPCs that our users are using are probably for scientific use, and are likely using x86_64 processors instead of arm. *On top of that*, when we publish installation instructions that include installing our conda package, we need to make clear that the conda packages should NOT be used on HPC installs. Instead, users need to follow their HPC's documentation for how to handle MPI loading and probably work with us to get them setup.     3. Anyone using Linux on Arm probably has the technical know-how to follow our non-conda, pip+MPI installation instructions.     4. If a user needs this, then we can provide it for that user, and also use their help to help us test the build. 2. Windows: How, or if, we build any conda packages for windows depends on #1041"

There are increasingly more consumer products using Windows on ARM64, though it's still going to be a small fraction of Windows users for probably many years. I don't think we need to provide that platform build at this time, unless a user gets in touch and can help us use it. *Eventually*, if we ever get our conda-package-building to build for different platforms using CI runners instead of local computers, it should be easy to add a Linux-ARM build."

Excitingly, there is now a way for us to install MPI using `pip` exclusively, instead of `conda`. Assuming everything works, we will be able to use `uv` not only for environment management and installation, but also building our packages and even future *binary wheels*! Copying my comment from elsewhere  Even more exciting is that if we don't need conda anymore for either OpenMPI installation or packaging, then we can start shipping binary wheels! We can pre-compile the MOD files that users need across platforms (using local or Github Actions), then ship a PyPI wheel that works with the pip openmpi package. (We could probably do this already, but previously it wasn't worth the time: we were already pre-compiling platform-specific conda packages for the same purpose.) This is especially nice since it means users probably (?) won't need to download compilers like GCC (Linux) or Xcode Command-Line Tools (Mac) just to run a simulation."

I have a feeling that the discussion has been fragmented which has led to a fragmented implementation. For a consistent IO implementation, one should plan in advance how the various compatibilities (between versions, between GUI and HNN-core) will be managed and document the format before implementing."

To me, this begs the question: in addition to not expanding our CI runs, why not also go further and decrease the CI runs we run by default? Now that we have a full-time developer, I think an effective setup could be the following:  - For all new PRs and their new commits, we run:     - The current CI runners for MacOS, Linux, and Windows, but only for one major version, such as 3.12, which I believe is the current default version used by Anaconda (which we recommend using).  - Separately, we make a new Github Action to run our CI runners for `master` across all supported Python versions, but only once or twice a month. The vast, vast majority of our bugs are not version incompatibilities, but if any do arise, then I can use these tests (or my own local cross-version tests) to catch them.  - Another idea, depending on difficulty, would be to split the Sphinx doc generation runner into 2 parts:     1. First part is the actual API documentation, autogenerated from docstrings etc., and whose runner could continue to run for every PR     2. Second part would be the CPU-expensive Examples and Tutorials documentation generation. Similarly to above, this could be run infrequently, such as part of the once or twice a month CI. I don't think these necessarily need to be re-done for every PR, although I have yet to dive into understanding CircleCI's caching. If we don't already, we should have some tests which mock what is required for all the function calls in the Examples and Tutorials of the documentation."

However, the failure message is not very helpful to a general user, and does not communicate the ""real"" install problem -- below is what I get if I try to install in a 3.13 environment:  ``` (test) {13:48}~/Desktop/hnn-core:master ✗ ➭ python -m pip install . Processing /Users/austinsoplata/Desktop/hnn-core   Installing build dependencies ... error   error: subprocess-exited-with-error    × pip subprocess to install build dependencies did not run successfully.   │ exit code: 1   ╰─> [4 lines of output]       Collecting setuptools>=40.8.0         Using cached setuptools-76.0.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (6.7 kB)       ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement NEURON>=7.7 (from versions: none)       ERROR: No matching distribution found for NEURON>=7.7       [end of output]    note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip. error: subprocess-exited-with-error  × pip subprocess to install build dependencies did not run successfully. │ exit code: 1 ╰─> See above for output.  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip. ```  This is the output that always occurs when I try to install in a 3.13 environment, *regardless of any Python-version changes or constraints I add to `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`*. The ""real"" install problem here is that when it says `Could not find a version...` it means that it couldn't find a version of Python that works for `NEURON>=7.7`, since NEURON currently doesn't allow installation on Python 3.13. The reason that this error shows despite any Python version restrictions elsewhere is I believe appears that the `pyproject.toml` `build-system` requirements (see https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core/blob/master/pyproject.toml#L2 ) are installed before any other part of the installation, including later Python version requirements.  In other words, even if, in our `setup.py`, we change `python_requires='>=3.8'` to `python_requires='>=3.8, < 3.13'`, that `python_requires` check is not run BEFORE the above `pyproject.toml` `build-system` requirements. Therefore, the above error shown is still what gets output.  Of course, I tried adding `python<3.13` etc. to the `pyproject.toml` `build-system` requirements, but checking the python version that way does not appear to be supported; I was getting failures in every case.  There *may* be a way to print a more user-friendly error if we use `build_meta` as shown in https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/build_meta.html#dynamic-build-dependencies-and-other-build-meta-tweaks but I think this is a terrible idea for many reasons. One reason in particular is any ""fixes"" we do will be obviated by whenever NEURON releases a 3.13 compatible version, which is probably not far off.  Given the above, **I propose the following**: We still change `setup.py`'s `python_requires='>=3.8'` to `python_requires='>=3.8, < 3.13'` and add the Classifiers like above, and we explicitly add mention of not currently supporting 3.13 to all install documentation. It is possible (I'm not sure) that if we next upload a version with these python version constraints to `pip`, that `pip` itself may provide a better version-mismatch error to the user before they try to install `NEURON>=7.7`; it certainly won't hurt."

The monthly metrics themselves (including the limitations of `issue-metrics`) are not extremely useful, and there are far better measurements of internal vs external contributions.     2.

The ""lowest"" level: {celltype} x {compartment} x {synapse type}. In practice, I believe this is going to be the most detailed level by which users will want to change the gain using the GUI (for the gain of literally individual cells/connections, they can use the API). An API function still needs to be created for this (or `net.update_weights()` expanded). For the GUI, this should be added to the location indicated by 2 in the following comment: https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core/issues/885#issuecomment-2341801255 . Note that in the GUI, this is where not only should the user be able to edit the final `gain`, but this should ALSO display the actual current value of the `gain` (this is important).  2. The ""highest"" level: the four main connection types: {e-e, e-i, i-e, i-i}. Nick has already implemented changing these in the API, but this needs to be added to the GUI. Note that while this is a common use case, it does *not* differentiate between layers, which is needed for the Gamma tutorial (see section 4.1 https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-tutorials/gamma/gamma ). Adding this to the GUI should be carefully considered: note that everything currently in the ""Network"" tab currently both 1. lets the user change a property, and 2. importantly, lets a user SEE the current value of a property. For the gain of these connections types, there are some valid cases where this will be impossible; for example, if `L2_pyramidal->L2_pyramidal`'s gain is 1, but `L2_pyramidal->L5_pyramidal`'s gain is 0, then we cannot display the current gain solely using the categories of {e-e, e-i, i-e, i-i}. For this reason, I think if we want to add functionality to modify the gain of these types, we do the following:       1. We add this as a separate tab next to ""Connectivity"" and ""Cell parameters"".      2. Have one entry for each of {e-e, e-i, i-e, i-i} (default 1), but title them similarly to ""Amount to multiply gain by""      3. Also have a purple button that says ""Multiply gains"" and clearly indicates that this is performing an ACTION, instead of representing the network itself.      4. Finally, the new, current values of the actual gains themselves will be updated and reflected on a per-{celltype}-x-{compartment} basis in the ""Connectivity"" tab.  4. We *could* add an intermediate level, such as {celltype}. In theory, this could go in the ""Cell parameters"" vbox (once it has been expanded to include all celltypes via https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core/issues/917 ). However, I don't think we should do this, since this won't add much value, but will increase the complexity. For example, if we wanted to add a per-celltype gain change from L2_pyramidal in the ""Cell parameters"" ""Synapses"" section, we would need to add many boxes like ""AMPA gain to L2_pyramidal"", ""AMPA gain to L2_basket"", ""AMPA gain to L5_pyramidal"", not to mention that it would only make sense to add the option per-synapse type. If we did this, we are basically re-inventing a second interface to do the same thing we will already have in the ""Connectivity"" tab.  Does anyone else have opinions about how to add synaptic gains to the GUI?"

We need to fix this before I can start revamping the code website. I've tried digging, but I honestly don't understand what is the fundamental cause of the issue. However, I think there's a chance that whatever fixes the version menubar dropdown issue will also fix #941.  - Context: the actual problem     - The problem may be that @ntolley (NT) did build and push the docs, but did NOT push an actual v0.4 github tag, or update `__init__.py` 's version (instead of 0.4rc0). Additionally, when the v0.4 docs were added and set as the new `stable`, the ""development"" version should have been incremented to 0.5, both in `doc/conf.py` and `__init__.py`. It's possible (I'm not convinced) that this is causing the problem.         - It's difficult (maybe impossible) to determine if this is the issue without explicitly making said tag, or making changes to the `gh-pages` branch         - I don't know if this would actually fix the dropdown issue. Part of what I don't understand is that the existing links in the dropdown SHOULD point to existing gh-pages subdirs.         - One possibility is there were issues with the build environment that was used to create the docs: one small piece of evidence for this is that for the `stable` docs, `mpi4py` wasn't actually installed: https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/stable/auto_examples/howto/plot_simulate_mpi_backend.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-howto-plot-simulate-mpi-backend-py . 1. Option 1: We un-do NT's v0.4 documentation push, and pretend they never happened.     - This requires undoing this commit and maybe some others: https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core/commit/d89d0f94fcbfa3ba668e77a18b9636ca0e1ee378         1. The current ""stable"" is replaced with v0.3 (which it arguably should be)         2. branch ""maint/0.4"" is deleted (since v0.4 is in development, NOT maintenance)         3. the folder ""v0.4"" in branch ""gh-pages"" is deleted     - The current version would stay like it is, v0.4rc4 or whatever. However, the documentation for it would *only* be live on the ""development"" branch of the website. If the dropdown works for the v0.3 and stable versions of the website, but not development, then that implies the issue is not due to improper versioning.     - This may not fix the dropdown issue and other issues like the search. However, it may, since the default website would revert to the v0.3 version, which does appear to work.     - This would redefine the ""stable"" verrsion of the website: it would NOT reflect the old version of 0.4 that NT pushed, but instead show v0.3. However, when we finish our v0.4 changes, those should work correctly then since it would be a complete release (including with git tags, etc.).     - To be clear, since we never had an ""official"" v0.4 release, this is more correct, since we are still arguably in the 0.4 development cycle.     - Due to the complexity of the doc build system, this is probably our best option to do now, and we can switch to a fundamentally different system later.     - This is equivalent to letting Austin tinker with the `gh-pages` branch. 2. Option 2: (I really don't like this) We ""artificially"" increment the version for the sake of the documentation.     - We would still have to re-build the v0.4 documentation based on the current master and overwrite NT's prior v0.4 doc pushes.     - Note that our ""current"" version would then be updated to be v0.5dev or something similar     - We would NOT have to publish this as an actual version on Pypi.     - I think this is less likely to solve the issue."

Specifically, dropdowns similar to our `Page` navbar entry and version list no longer appear to be working for the theme as a whole: https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/issues/227 . The first example here https://sphinx-themes.org/sample-sites/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/ illustrates the same problem. The repo hasn't had a release in about 3 years, and appears abandoned.  Fortunately, I believe we will be able to re-enable version switching if we, like MNE, switch to the actively-updated Pydata Sphinx theme (very limited example: https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pull/10605/files ). This also has the nice quality of allowing us to define all our versions in a JSON file (see https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/version-dropdown.html ) rather than as raw html that is added via templating."

I don't think this is a worthwhile change, in part because of Nick's point that absence is purposeful, and it increases code complexity, and if the user wants to add non-standard connections or synapses, they can do so by 1. creating a custom network in the API, then exporting it, then 2. importing it into the GUI. I don't think we want to start supporting being able to make major architectural changes to the internal Connectivity of a Network in the GUI (as opposed to drivers) -- there are additional things we could theoretically allow changes to as well, like which section a connection goes to, which celltypes go to which, etc. This is why I think it's better to say ""use the API for that"" instead of allowing ""structural"" changes to the GUI."

Currently, it appears that the drives in tab `External drives` are ordered according to the sequence in which they were added to or created in the network.  If we wanted to do this, I guess we could take whatever is closest to the ""time of the drive"" (the mean time or start time, depending on the drive), then show those values in the title of each accordion entry (so users know what is being used to sort them), then re-order them according to those values when the widget is re-drawn. This would also have to be done separately at the time of initial loading of the Network too.  I'm not sure this adds much value or is worth our time, however, since any input histograms are going to make the global order of drives obvious. I think it's okay to leave this as-is if we fix other issues, like the fact that the input histogram doesn't always differentiate between drives:   <img width=""631"" height=""169"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc35f8d1-b933-46b7-8347-9788db32ddcf"" />"

This plot is always going to be very small in our default GUI figure, and with too many drives added the legend can go out of bounds and cause issues. And the naming convention/color is specifically used here to highlight the differences between proximal/distal, consistent with out papers and tutorials. But they should just be renamed to 'proximal' and 'distal'.  I do think proper order by arrival time is a worthwhile effort, albeit low priority"

If we're locked to using a single color for distal as opposed to proximal, then we can't use more colors to differentiate between different drives coming into the same sections. And if that's the case, then the point of the legend is not to uniquely identify each drive, but instead to ONLY identify whether a drive is distal or proximal.   Maybe one change we could make is have only 2 entries for the legend (like they currently are), but have the entries themselves change to something like   ``` Proximal: exprox ``` and ``` Distal: evdist1, evdist2 ``` etc.  This would make them wider but I think that's okay since we've already got transparency.

Any idea why it's still failing?  If I recall correctly, the goal with the GUI was to expose as little of the parallel backend API as possible while still running the tutorials in a timely manner. Since almost all of the tutorials run single trials, `JoblibBackend` isn't very useful and `MPIBackend` can easily be run under the hood by defaulting to the maximal number of parallel jobs.  We can still convert to `len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))`, but I personally don't think it's necessary to expose the `n_procs` argument in the GUI. Big picture, I think there's something to be said for the GUI running without too much technical bloat that will confuse new users."

I guess I see the GUI primarily an educational tool, so while I agree that adding the number of cores as a simulation parameter in the GUI isn't, in itself, a deal breaker, I think there's something to be said for a GUI simulation that ""just runs"" without having to sift through a myriad of parameters that don't directly relate to the scientific discourse of our workshops."
